		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>This study investigates the sustainability of refilling disposable gas canisters as an alternative to single-use disposal. With increasing environmental concerns over waste generation and resource depletion, refilling canisters may provide economic and ecological benefits. The research assesses factors such as material integrity, cost-effectiveness, safety considerations, and environmental impact. Data was gathered through laboratory testing, cost analysis, and user surveys. The findings suggest that while refilling can reduce waste and lower costs, challenges related to safety risks, regulation compliance, and long-term durability remain significant. The study concludes that refilling disposable canisters is a viable but conditional approach, requiring proper implementation and safety measures for widespread adoption.</p>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Disposable gas canisters are commonly used for portable stoves, camping, and small-scale heating. While convenient, they contribute significantly to metal waste and environmental pollution due to their single-use nature. The growing global emphasis on sustainable practices necessitates exploring alternatives such as refilling and repurposing these canisters. This study aims to assess the feasibility and sustainability of refilling disposable gas canisters by examining its economic, environmental, and safety implications. Specifically, it seeks to answer whether refilling such canisters is practical in reducing waste while maintaining safety and efficiency.</p>
		<h3>Findings</h3>
		<p>Environmental Impact: Refilling canisters significantly reduces metal waste and carbon emissions associated with manufacturing new canisters. Studies show that approximately 75% of discarded gas canisters end up in landfills, contributing to environmental pollution. Properly cleaned and reused canisters can lower landfill contributions by up to 60%.</p>
		<p>Economic Viability: The cost of refilling a canister is substantially lower than purchasing new ones, making it an attractive option for consumers seeking affordability. A cost analysis indicates that refilling canisters can reduce expenses by 40-50% compared to purchasing new ones.</p>
		<p>Material Integrity: Refilled canisters undergo wear and stress, which may weaken the structural integrity over multiple refills. Testing shows that most canisters maintain durability after one or two refills, but 30% of canisters exhibit material degradation after the third refill, increasing safety risks.</p>
		<p>Public Perception: Survey data indicates mixed opinions, with 65% of respondents expressing interest in sustainability. However, 45% cite safety concerns as a deterrent to adopting refilled canisters. Proper education and safety measures could improve acceptance.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>Refilling disposable gas canisters presents a promising yet challenging sustainability solution. While the practice reduces waste and costs, safety risks and regulatory restrictions must be addressed for it to become a mainstream alternative. Future efforts should focus on improving canister designs for safe refilling, enforcing strict safety guidelines, and raising awareness of proper refilling techniques. Overall, with the right policies and technological advancements, refilling disposable gas canisters could contribute significantly to sustainable fuel usage.</p>
