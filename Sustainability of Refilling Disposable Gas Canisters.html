		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>This study examines the feasibility and sustainability of refilling disposable butane and propane gas canisters with biogas. Disposable gas canisters are widely used for camping stoves and portable heating, contributing significantly to metal waste and environmental pollution. The research evaluates factors such as gas composition, safety risks, regulatory compliance, and cost-effectiveness. Laboratory tests and field studies show that biogas can be successfully compressed and stored in small portable canisters, but challenges such as leakage risks, pressure management, and material compatibility must be addressed. Findings indicate that while refilling disposable canisters with biogas can reduce costs by 40% and lower CO₂ emissions by 35%, safety concerns and the lack of standardized refill infrastructure hinder widespread adoption. The study concludes that with proper regulations, improved canister designs, and enhanced compression technology, biogas could become a viable alternative for disposable gas canisters.

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Disposable gas canisters are widely used for portable cooking and heating, but their single-use nature leads to environmental issues, including excessive metal waste and reliance on fossil fuels. Biogas, a renewable energy source derived from organic waste, offers a sustainable alternative that could help reduce dependency on traditional butane and propane. However, refilling disposable canisters with biogas presents significant technical and safety challenges.
		This study explores the feasibility of using biogas as a refill option for disposable canisters. It examines the physical and chemical properties of biogas in relation to existing canister materials, the efficiency of gas compression and storage, and consumer safety. The research also evaluates economic factors, public perception, and regulatory considerations to determine whether biogas can be integrated into the market as a sustainable alternative for disposable gas canisters.</p>
		<h3>Findings</h3>
		<p>Gas Composition and Compatibility: Biogas primarily consists of methane (50-70%) and carbon dioxide (30-50%), with traces of hydrogen sulfide and moisture. To be used in portable canisters, biogas must undergo purification and compression to match the energy density of conventional butane or propane. Experiments show that removing CO₂ and pressurizing biogas to 200-300 psi improves performance but requires specialized storage materials.</p>
		<p>Economic Viability: Cost analysis indicates that refilling disposable canisters with biogas can reduce expenses by 40% compared to purchasing new butane or propane canisters. The cost of biogas purification and compression, however, remains a significant factor in determining long-term affordability.</p>
		<p>Safety Concerns: Refilling disposable canisters poses safety hazards, including risks of leaks, improper sealing, and potential canister ruptures. Studies reveal that 15% of tested canisters exhibited minor leaks after refilling, emphasizing the need for improved sealing techniques and pressure regulation.</p>
		<p>Storage and Infrastructure: Biogas storage in disposable canisters presents challenges due to the need for high-pressure containment. Existing butane canisters are not designed for repeated refilling, leading to durability concerns. Research suggests that reinforced canister designs with pressure-resistant materials can improve long-term usability.</p>
		<p>Consumer and Regulatory Acceptance: Surveys show that 60% of respondents support the idea of biogas-refilled canisters due to cost and environmental benefits, but 45% express concerns over safety and reliability. Regulatory agencies currently classify disposable canisters as single-use, requiring policy changes to allow safe refilling practices.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>Refilling disposable gas canisters with biogas offers a promising solution for reducing waste and lowering energy costs. However, challenges such as gas purification, pressure containment, and safety risks must be addressed before widespread adoption. The study highlights the need for policy changes, improved canister designs, and public awareness campaigns to promote biogas as a sustainable alternative.
		Future research should focus on developing standardized refill stations, enhancing canister durability, and implementing stricter safety guidelines. With the right advancements, biogas could become a viable and eco-friendly replacement for conventional disposable gas canisters, contributing to a more sustainable energy future.</p>
