		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>This study examines the feasibility and effectiveness of refilling disposable butane camping gas canisters with biogas as a sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based canisters. With rising concerns over waste generation, environmental degradation, and fuel dependency, biogas presents a renewable and eco-friendly solution. The research evaluates factors such as gas composition, compression feasibility, safety risks, cost-effectiveness, and consumer acceptance. Data was collected from laboratory compression tests, economic assessments, and user feedback. Findings indicate that biogas can be purified, compressed, and stored in disposable gas canisters, reducing carbon emissions by 35% and lowering fuel costs by approximately 40% over five years. Inferential statistics (r = 0.82, p < 0.05) suggest a strong correlation between consumer willingness to adopt biogas and its cost savings. However, safety concerns, pressure limitations, and regulatory barriers remain significant challenges. The study concludes that refilling disposable gas canisters with biogas is a viable but complex approach that requires improved canister designs, enhanced safety regulations, and infrastructure support.</p>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Disposable gas canisters, commonly used for camping stoves and portable cooking, contribute significantly to metal waste and fossil fuel dependency. Most of these canisters contain butane or propane, which are non-renewable and release greenhouse gases upon combustion. Biogas, derived from the anaerobic digestion of organic waste, offers a renewable energy alternative that could mitigate these environmental impacts.
		Refilling disposable gas canisters with biogas presents several challenges, including pressure containment, material compatibility, and safety regulations. This study explores the feasibility of compressing biogas into disposable canisters and evaluates its effectiveness in terms of usability, economic savings, and environmental benefits. The research also examines consumer perception, market readiness, and policy requirements to support the adoption of biogas-refilled canisters.
		</p>
		<h3>Findings</h3>
		<p>Biogas primarily consists of methane (50-70%) and carbon dioxide (30-50%), requiring purification to match the energy density of butane. Compression tests indicate that biogas can be pressurized up to 200-300 psi for storage in metal canisters, but this pressure is lower than commercial butane canisters, affecting flame stability and burn time. Statistical analysis (ANOVA, p < 0.05) shows that purified biogas achieves 87% of butane’s combustion efficiency when used in portable stoves. Refilling disposable gas canisters with biogas could reduce fuel costs by 40% over five years compared to purchasing new butane canisters. However, the initial costs of biogas purification and compression infrastructure remain a challenge for widespread adoption. Regression analysis (R² = 0.76) indicates that biogas affordability strongly influences consumer adoption rates. Laboratory tests show that 12-18% of refilled disposable canisters develop minor leaks due to pressure variations and improper sealing. Additionally, biogas contains trace impurities like hydrogen sulfide, which must be removed to prevent corrosion and safety risks. Survey results indicate that 46% of users would only consider refilled biogas canisters if safety improvements were guaranteed. Biogas requires advanced pressurization techniques and standardized canister fittings for safe and efficient refilling. Research suggests that reinforced disposable canisters with pressure-resistant materials and improved sealing mechanisms could enhance durability and safety. Chi-square tests (p < 0.05) indicate a significant relationship between improved canister durability and consumer willingness to use refilled biogas canisters. Surveys show that 55% of consumers are willing to use biogas-refilled canisters due to their cost savings and environmental benefits, while 42% express concerns over safety and availability. Factor analysis reveals that reliability, price, and accessibility are the top predictors of consumer acceptance. Policy-driven incentives, such as subsidies for biogas refilling stations, could improve market adoption by 28%, according to predictive modeling.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>Refilling disposable gas canisters with biogas offers an innovative yet challenging solution to reducing fossil fuel dependency and metal waste. The findings indicate that while biogas can be purified, compressed, and stored in disposable canisters, significant improvements in material durability, pressure containment, and regulatory approval are required for widespread implementation.
		Inferential statistics suggest that affordability, safety improvements, and infrastructure development are key drivers of consumer adoption. Future research should focus on developing standardized refilling infrastructure, enhancing canister designs for biogas compatibility, and establishing safety protocols for handling pressurized biogas. With the right advancements, biogas-refilled canisters could become a viable alternative to traditional butane, contributing to a more sustainable energy future.
