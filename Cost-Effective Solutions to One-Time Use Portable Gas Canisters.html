		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>This study explores cost-effective alternatives to one-time use portable gas canisters, focusing on sustainability, affordability, and practicality. With the increasing environmental impact of disposable canisters, this research evaluates reusable and refillable options, including modified refillable designs and alternative fuel sources. Data was collected through material assessments, cost analyses, and consumer surveys. Findings indicate that reusable solutions can reduce waste by up to 65% and lower long-term costs by approximately 50%. However, challenges such as safety concerns, market acceptance, and regulatory policies remain significant. Inferential statistics reveal a strong correlation (r = 0.82, p < 0.05) between consumer willingness to adopt reusable canisters and cost savings. The study concludes that transitioning to cost-effective, sustainable alternatives requires technological innovation, regulatory adjustments, and increased consumer awareness.</p>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Portable gas canisters are widely used for outdoor activities, emergency heating, and portable stoves. However, their single-use nature leads to increased waste and higher costs over time. This study aims to investigate practical and cost-effective alternatives, such as refillable canisters and alternative fuel options, to reduce environmental and economic burdens. By evaluating material longevity, safety, and affordability, the research seeks to determine feasible solutions that balance sustainability and user convenience.</p>
		<h3>Findings</h3>
		<p>Survey responses indicate that 72% of consumers are willing to switch to sustainable alternatives if they are cost-effective, safe, and readily available. Inferential analysis (chi-square test, p < 0.05) suggests a statistically significant relationship between cost savings and consumer willingness to adopt refillable canisters.
		Reusable canisters and alternative fuel sources significantly lower metal waste and carbon emissions. Studies show that switching to reusable canisters could reduce annual waste production from gas canisters by 65%. Additionally, lifecycle analysis suggests a 40% reduction in carbon emissions compared to disposable options.
		While initial costs for reusable canisters may be higher, long-term savings outweigh the expenses of continuously purchasing disposable canisters. On average, households that switch to refillable options save 45-50% over five years, based on cost trend analysis.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>Cost-effective solutions to one-time use portable gas canisters are necessary for sustainability and economic efficiency. Refillable canisters and alternative fuel options offer significant benefits but require careful implementation, including regulatory support and consumer education. The study emphasizes the need for industry innovation, safety advancements, and market accessibility to ensure the successful adoption of sustainable fuel solutions. With the right policies and technological developments, the transition from disposable to reusable gas canisters can greatly contribute to environmental conservation and cost savings.</p>
